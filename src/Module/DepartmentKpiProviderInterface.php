/**
 * THE seam a module bundle implements to put figures on a department's performance surfaces.
 *
 * The model canon, restated as a contract:
 *
 *  - A department has no numbers of its own. Everything a performance page shows is an attached
 *    module's KPIs, so this interface is the ONLY way a figure gets there.
 *  - The figures are summed over the areas the module is switched on in — the implementation's
 *    business, since only the module knows what an "area" means to it.
 *  - They are SLICED BY THE RECORDING PERSON'S POSITION: a row counts for a department when the
 *    person who recorded it holds a position filed under that department. One shared module read
 *    by two departments therefore yields two different numbers from the same rows, and neither
 *    department is fenced out of the other's — the split is reporting, never permission.
 *
 * HOW AN IMPLEMENTOR IS COLLECTED. {@see DepartmentKpiService} reads the `uhifadhi.department_kpi`
 * tag, and the tag is applied EXPLICITLY at both ends:
 *
 *  - a MODULE BUNDLE tags its provider in its extension, because a reusable bundle is not
 *    autoconfigured (Symfony's bundle best practices forbid it) — exactly as it already does for
 *    `uhifadhi.module`;
 *  - a HOST service carries `#[AutoconfigureTag(DepartmentKpiProviderInterface::TAG)]` ON ITS OWN
 *    CLASS.
 *
 * That last line is a real constraint, not a style note: Symfony's
 * `RegisterAutoconfigureAttributesPass` reads attributes off the DEFINITION'S OWN CLASS only, and
 * PHP does not inherit attributes from an implemented interface — so an `#[AutoconfigureTag]`
 * written here would be silently dead, and the only symptom would be every figure quietly
 * disappearing from every performance surface. Tagging via `Kernel::registerForAutoconfiguration()`
 * (as `ModuleProviderInterface` does) would collect implementors automatically and is the natural
 * home for this if a host-side provider is ever written.
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Tests\Integration\DepartmentKpiTagTest} pins all of it.
