/**
 * A whole layout of one surface, named and described: "adopt this design
 * wholesale".
 *
 * A widget library lets a person assemble a dashboard one widget at a time,
 * which is the right tool once they know what they want and a poor one on the
 * first visit. A preset is the other door: the design directions a surface was
 * drawn in, each applicable in one click. The catalogue's groups already ARE
 * those directions — a preset is the same direction expressed as a layout.
 *
 * The layout is total: a widget LISTED is on, at the width listed, in the listed
 * position; a widget ABSENT is off. There is no third state, so adopting a
 * preset can never leave a stray widget from the previous arrangement behind.
 *
 * Like a {@see WidgetCatalog} this is CODE, not input: a preset naming a widget
 * the surface does not ship, or a width it does not offer, throws at
 * construction (the width check needs the catalogue, so it happens when the
 * preset is attached to one).
