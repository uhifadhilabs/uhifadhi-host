 * A headed section of the widget library: a handful of widgets that answer the

 * for. The description is deliberately a single line — a library whose headings
 * need a paragraph is a library whose grouping is wrong.
 *
 * Groups are a library-side reading only. They do not scope a layout: the
 * dashboard grid is one ordered list, and dragging moves a widget across the
 * whole surface, not within its group.
