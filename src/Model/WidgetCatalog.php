/**
 * THE catalogue of one dashboard surface: which widgets it ships, what each is
 * called, which headed section of the library it belongs to, how wide it sits by
 * default and how wide a person may make it.
 *
 * A surface registers exactly one of these and the dashboard, the widget library
 * and the save endpoint all read it, so a widget can never exist on one screen
 * and not the other. The `surface` string is what a stored preference row is
 * keyed by, so it is stable across releases: two surfaces may both ship a widget
 * called "map" and neither ever sees the other's row.
 *
 * Declaration order is the default order; the design's own layout is simply the
 * order the widgets are listed in.
 *
 * PRESETS are optional: a surface may also name whole layouts a person can adopt
 * in one click ({@see WidgetPreset}). A surface that ships none is complete
 * without them — the library's preset strip is guarded on `presets|length` and
 * simply is not drawn.
 *
 * THE ACTIVE-PRESET MODEL (2026-08): a dashboard renders exactly ONE preset —
 * one the surface ships, or one the person saved. There is no anonymous layout,
 * so the catalogue's own composition (declaration order, each widget's $on and
 * $cols) is itself a preset: {@see builtins()} leads the strip with it whenever
 * no declared preset already IS that layout. Built-ins are immutable; the only
 * way one changes is a copy into the person's own presets.
 *
 * ADDITIONS ARE APPENDED WITH DEFAULTS. Every constructor argument past
 * `$presets` was added after module bundles were already building against this
 * class, so every existing `new WidgetCatalog($surface, $groups, $widgets)` and
 * `…, $presets)` call keeps compiling and keeps meaning what it meant.
