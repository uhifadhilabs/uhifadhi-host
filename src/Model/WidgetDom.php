/**
 * The WIRE between a widget-library page and assets/widgets.js: every attribute
 * the script drives the page through, and the header both writes carry their
 * CSRF token in.
 *
 * It is a class of constants rather than a convention because of a real bug in
 * the patrols module: the controller validated a CSRF token, the template
 * rendered one — and the script never sent it. Every server-side test passed
 * (each builds its own header); only a browser ever saw the 403. So the names
 * live HERE, a template renders them from here, and
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Tests\Unit\WidgetLibraryAssetsTest} reads widgets.js as text
 * and proves both sides spell them the same way.
 *
 * A template renders these by exposing the class to Twig (`constant(...)`) or by
 * passing them in; either way it must never retype the literal.
