/**
 * A layout one person saved under their own name, on one dashboard SURFACE: the
 * other half of presets. A surface SHIPS the design directions it was drawn in;
 * a person KEEPS the arrangements they actually work in ("morning check",
 * "board meeting") and puts one back on in a click.
 *
 * The scoping trio is the one {@see WidgetPreference} uses — surface, user, and
 * a nullable area for the surfaces that have one — held as plain values for the
 * same reason: a saved layout is a UI scrap and deleting an area must never be
 * blocked by one. It is addressed externally by its UUID, never by the
 * sequential id.
 *
 * `layout` is a {@see \Uhifadhi\Model\WidgetPreset} layout — widget id => span,
 * in order, listed meaning on — NOT the stored-preference shape. It is written
 * from a resolved layout and read back tolerantly, so a preset saved before a
 * widget was retired still applies.
