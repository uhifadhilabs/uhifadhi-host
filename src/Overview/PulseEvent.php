/**
 * ONE MOVE IN THE AREA PULSE.
 *
 * The pulse is NOT a log of records — it is a log of MOVES: a patrol opened, an
 * incident changed state, an observation was logged. Every module already keeps
 * one (patrol events, incident events), and they all have the same shape: a
 * time, a record, what happened, and who did it. That is why one component can
 * draw all of them and why a new module needs no work on this widget.
 *
 * The host merges and sorts by time, groups by day, and prints the contributor's
 * name on every row. It does not interpret `$move`.
