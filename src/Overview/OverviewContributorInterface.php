/**
 * THE SEAM A MODULE PUTS WIDGETS ON AN AREA'S OVERVIEW THROUGH.
 *
 * `/areas/{uuid}` is the first surface in the product whose widgets are not
 * written by whoever owns the page. The HOST owns the surface, the grid, the
 * preset framework and the identity of the area; EVERY OPERATIONAL WIDGET
 * arrives here, from a module installed in that area.
 *
 * THE OPEN/CLOSED RULE, WRITTEN DOWN. Installing `uhifadhilabs/permits-module`
 * in an area adds a headed section to the library, its widgets, and — through
 * the three sibling interfaces — its tiles, its items and its layers. It does
 * not touch this file, the host's overview controller, the grid, or any other
 * module. Uninstalling it removes exactly the same things, and a saved preset
 * that named one of its widgets skips it: the catalogue is assembled per area
 * and the resolver is tolerant.
 *
 * A GROUP HERE IS A CONTRIBUTOR, NOT A DESIGN DIRECTION. Everywhere else in the
 * product a headed section of a widget library is one of the five directions a
 * surface was drawn in, because one module wrote every widget. Here the division
 * that matters is PROVENANCE: a person needs to know that "Out right now" came
 * from Patrols, so that when Patrols is uninstalled its disappearance reads as
 * the system working rather than as a bug. The five directions are still there —
 * they are presets, they are just not the group axis.
 *
 * A MODULE MAY CONTRIBUTE A WHOLE COLUMN as well as individual widgets: one
 * widget that is its entire overview section, heading and cards, stacked. The
 * rule that keeps it honest is the module's to keep — a column may only include
 * widgets the module already contributes on their own, so a card can never read
 * differently in the two.
 *
 * HOW AN IMPLEMENTOR IS COLLECTED. {@see \Uhifadhi\Service\AreaOverviewCatalogue}
 * reads the {@see TAG}, and the tag is applied EXPLICITLY at both ends: a module
 * bundle tags its contributor in its extension, because a reusable bundle is not
 * autoconfigured; a host service carries `#[AutoconfigureTag(self::TAG)]` ON ITS
 * OWN CLASS, because Symfony reads autoconfigure attributes off the definition's
 * own class and PHP does not inherit attributes from an interface — an
 * `#[AutoconfigureTag]` written here would be silently dead. The same constraint
 * is documented, and pinned by a test, on
 * {@see \Uhifadhi\Module\DepartmentKpiProviderInterface}.
