/**
 * ONE TILE OF THE RIGHT-NOW STRIP — the clearest place the seam shows.
 *
 * The host draws the strip and orders it. It writes no tile it does not own:
 * install a module and its tiles join the row, uninstall it and they leave.
 * The same tiles are what the duty board draws at board density, so a number
 * can never read one way in the strip and another on the wall.
 *
 * THE INDEX IS PROVENANCE. `PL·N1` is the patrols module's first now-tile;
 * `AO·N1` is the host's own. It is printed on the plate because provenance has
 * to survive a screenshot.
 *
 * ABSENT IS NOT ZERO. A module with nothing to say returns no tile — it does
 * not return a tile reading 0, which would claim it measured and found none.
