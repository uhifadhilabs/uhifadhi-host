/**
 * THE SEAM A MODULE PUTS ITS OWN WORDS INTO A HOST SENTENCE THROUGH — the fifth
 * member of the family that already holds now-tiles, attention items, map layers
 * and pulse events.
 *
 * WHY A SEAM FOR PROSE. Two of the host's own strings named module vocabulary
 * outright, copied verbatim from the design: the operational map's picker note
 * said "today's tracks and open incidents", and the "Map as ground" thesis said
 * a person could spot "a stranded patrol". They read perfectly — and they were
 * the host knowing what a patrol is, on a page whose whole argument is that it
 * does not. Uninstall incidents and the map's own note went on promising open
 * incidents to an area that had none to draw.
 *
 * A FRAGMENT, NEVER A SENTENCE. A module contributes a NOUN PHRASE — "today's
 * tracks", "a stranded patrol" — and the host builds the sentence around it:
 * the punctuation, the conjunction and the clause order are the host's copy,
 * because they belong to a sentence no single module can see the whole of. That
 * is also what lets the sentence degrade honestly: with one module installed it
 * simply says less, and with none it says only what the host can draw.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SEAM-FED. The future-module slot names candidate modules by name
 * on purpose — naming what the catalogue holds IS that widget's job, and there
 * is no installed module to ask.
 *
 * Tagged explicitly at both ends, for the reason
 * {@see OverviewContributorInterface} spells out.
