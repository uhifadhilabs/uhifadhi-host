/**
 * ONE ROW OF "NEEDS ATTENTION" — the host owns the list, a module owns the item.
 *
 * The area overview's attention list is not a list the host wrote. Every row is
 * returned by an installed module: a patrol that has stopped pinging, an
 * observation nobody filed, an incident past its term, a zone nobody has
 * entered. The host merges them, sorts them by urgency and draws them all
 * identically. That is the whole point of the seam — the host does not know what
 * a snare line is and must not, because the day it does, uninstalling a module
 * leaves a hard-coded row behind.
 *
 * NOBODY DISMISSES ONE BY HAND. An item leaves the list when the thing that
 * raised it is dealt with, because the host never stored it: the aggregator asks
 * every provider on every render. There is no acknowledged flag here on purpose.
 *
 * @see AttentionProviderInterface
