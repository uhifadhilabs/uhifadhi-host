/**
 * THE SEAM A MODULE PUTS A ROW IN THE HOST'S "NEEDS ATTENTION" LIST THROUGH.
 *
 * The host merges every installed module's items, sorts them by urgency — never
 * by module — and draws them all identically. It does not know what a snare line
 * is and must not: the day it does, uninstalling a module leaves a row behind.
 *
 * Nothing is stored. The aggregator asks every provider on every render, so an
 * item leaves the list when the thing that raised it is dealt with and nobody
 * ever dismisses one by hand.
 *
 * Returning `[]` is the right answer on a good day, and a good day is allowed to
 * look like one.
 *
 * Tagged explicitly at both ends, for the reason
 * {@see OverviewContributorInterface} spells out.
