 * THE SEAM A MODULE WRITES INTO THE AREA PULSE THROUGH.
 *
 * The platform-wide move log the roadmap plans (Symfony Workflow plus an audit
 * trail) does not exist yet — but every module already keeps its own: the
 * patrols module has patrol events, the incidents module has incident events.
 * They have the same shape, so the pulse asks each module for its moves in a
 * window and merges them, rather than waiting for a log that has not been built.
 * When the platform log lands, this seam is what it fills.
 *
 * Tagged explicitly at both ends, for the reason
 * {@see OverviewContributorInterface} spells out.
