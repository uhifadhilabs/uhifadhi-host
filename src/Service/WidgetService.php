/**
 * The platform's widget framework: one person's layout of one dashboard surface,
 * resolved from that surface's {@see WidgetCatalog} and their stored row.
 *
 * Generalised from the patrols module's battle-tested service — same merge,
 * validation and clamping semantics, with the catalogue handed in rather than
 * hard-coded, so every dashboard in the app arranges itself the same way and a
 * module ships a catalogue rather than a copy of this algebra.
 *
 * The merge and validation rules are static and pure — stored preferences are
 * untrusted input (a browser wrote them, and a release may have retired a widget
 * since), so reading them can never throw and writing them can never store an id
 * or a span the catalogue does not offer.
 *
 * PRESETS are whole layouts rather than one person's current one: the designs a
 * surface ships ({@see WidgetCatalog::presets()}) and the ones a person saved
 * ({@see WidgetCustomPreset}). Both are converted to an ordinary payload and
 * written through {@see save()} — there is exactly one path into a
 * stored row, and adopting a design is not an exception to it.
 *
 * THE ACTIVE-PRESET MODEL (2026-08)
 * ---------------------------------
 * There is NO ANONYMOUS LAYOUT. A dashboard renders exactly one preset, and the
 * stored row names it ({@see WidgetPreference::getActiveKind()}). A person who
 * has never chosen is active on the surface's default built-in
 * ({@see WidgetCatalog::defaultPresetId()}), which is why a fresh dashboard is
 * still "a preset" and the library's strip always has exactly one Active card.
 *
 * BUILT-INS ARE IMMUTABLE. They are the designs the product ships, so
 * {@see save()} REFUSES a layout while one is active: the way a shipped design
 * changes is {@see copyBuiltinPreset()}, and the copy is what gets edited.
 * Editing while a CUSTOM preset is active WRITES THROUGH to that preset's own
 * row — the preset is the layout, so there is nothing else to save.
 *
 * SOURCE COMPATIBILITY. Every method below kept the signature module bundles
 * were already calling; the model's needs arrived as arguments appended with
 * defaults ({@see saveCustomPreset()}) or as new methods. Behaviour changed in
 * exactly one place, and deliberately: applying or creating a preset now also
 * makes it active, because in this model that is what applying MEANS.
